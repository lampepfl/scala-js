/* !!!!!
 * THIS FILE IS ALMOST COPY-PASTED IN javalib/ AND library/.
 * THEY MUST BE KEPT IN SYNC.
 *
 * This file acts as bridge for scala.scalajs.js.typedarray to be able to
 * access the additional public API provided by java.nio, but which is not
 * part of the JDK API. Because javalib/ does not export its .class files,
 * we cannot call this additonal API directly from library/, even though the
 * members are public.
 *
 * In library/, this file has only the signatures, with stub implementations.
 * In javalib/, it has the proper the proper implementations.
 * The build keeps the .class coming from library/ and the .sjsir file from
 * javalib/. This way, we bridge the library and javalib. But that means the
 * binary interface of TypedArrayBufferBridge must be strictly equivalent in
 * the two copies.
 *
 * (Yes, this is a hack.)
